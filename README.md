## Usage

### Basic Usage

To clone all non-fork repositories from a specified GitHub user or organization:

```bash
clone-it-all <github-username-or-organization>
```

-   `<github-username-or-organization>`: The GitHub username or organization from which to clone repositories.

### Example

Clone all repositories from `someusername` into a folder named `someusername` in the current directory:

```bash
clone-it-all someusername
```

### Including Forks

To include forked repositories in the clone operation, use the `--with-forks` flag:

```bash
clone-it-all <github-username-or-organization> --with-forks
```

### Specifying an Output Folder

To specify a custom output folder, use the `--output` option:

```bash
clone-it-all <github-username-or-organization> --output /path/to/output-folder
```

### Example

Clone all repositories, including forks, from `someusername` into `/path/to/output-folder`:

```bash
clone-it-all someusername --with-forks --output /path/to/output-folder
```

## Options

-   `--with-forks`: Include forked repositories in the cloning process. By default, forks are ignored.
-   `--output <output-folder>`: Specify the output folder where repositories will be cloned. Defaults to a folder named after the GitHub username or organization in the current directory.
-   `--help`: Display the help message and exit.
